  description: `We came up with TasteMakers because we wanted a social media app that focused on keeping friends connected and encouraging city exploration.
  
TasteMakers is a mobile app because it has features that users will use on the go. It shows users what their friends have been up to through snapshots. A snapshot mainly consists of a location, photo, and description.
  
My contributions included wire-framing, schema design, full stack engineering, and UX design. Some of the main features I implemented were friend requests, user authentication, and application animations.`,

I learned to pick up two new libraries and compile its documentation in just a couple days. I also started using Tiled App immediately because I'm used to using different design softwares like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Rhino 3D.`,

I took initiative in the product slice and we pair programmed the shopping cart component. Some features included viewing a single product, the capability to add or remove a desired amount to or from the shopping cart, and checking out the cart which turns it into a past order.`,
